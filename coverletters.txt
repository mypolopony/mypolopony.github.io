Hi LeoLabs,

I am a statistical modeler and data infrastructure architect looking for a new opportunity with an exciting company. 

I've worn many hats in my previous positions: I design APIs and databases, manage cloud resources for large data processing, generate predictive models, write core libraries, built ETL pipelines, and manage ecosystems of microservices, among others!

I focus strongly on understanding data flows on a fundamental level and take care to deeply consider the nature of the inputs and outputs with the goal of creating harmonized platforms for high-speed, high-accuracy insights. I've had the pleasure of working with large data sets of all sorts: biological (gene expression and proteomics), time series (electrophysiology and electromagnetic seismology), geospatial (GIS), neuroimaging (fMRI), clinical healthcare (electronic medical records), and optical (embedded computer vision systems). My aim is to resist black box solutions when possible and instead dive into the data with the goal of designing intelligent algorithms and processing streams with context-specific knowledge. Testable, scalable, robust automation is core to the problems I enjoy solving. I'm a big fan of clean code, orchestration (IaC) and rapid integration.

My typical stacks usually include some combination of C++/Python/R; MLflow and ZenML with TensorFlow/Scikit-Learn for MLOps; Airflow and Docker for orchestration; Terraform for infrastructure; the AWS ecosphere for cloud solutions (ECS, EC2, SageMaker, Glue, DynamoDB, Lambda); Kafka for event messaging; pySpark for feature engineering; Snowflake / Redshift for data warehousing; distributed MongoDB for NoSQL. 

Generally, I like working with empathetic folks, both engineers and non-engineers alike, that have personal depth, unique insights and different approaches. Please feel free to check out my profile or my resume (mypolopony.github.io) -- I'd love to chat more!

Cheers,

Hi Arable,

I'm a data engineer looking for a new opportunity with an exciting company. Your mission, combining high-fidelity field data with cutting-edge models to drive agricultural resilience, deeply aligns with my own path. I’ve spent the past decade building machine learning systems around messy, real-world sensor streams, and I'm eager to bring that experience to a company working at the heart of the global food and climate challenge.

At AgriData, I led the development of a computer vision and sensor fusion platform for precision agriculture. I architected the entire edge-to-cloud pipeline, designing hardware integrations (LIDAR, GPS, IMU), building computer vision models for plant health, and scaling out inference across a live fleet. I built both the model infrastructure and the physical systems from the ground up, experience that taught me how to move fast while validating rigorously in agricultural conditions.

At Sound Agriculture, I built predictive pipelines for water and nutrient management using a combination of satellite imagery, weather forecasts, soil maps, and in-field observations. I designed and deployed end-to-end ML systems leveraging commercial and in-house Python libraries, Airflow, SageMaker, and Flask APIs that translated raw geospatial and temporal data into field-level irrigation and nutrient recommendations. Much of this work paralleled the kinds water balance modeling described in your posting, with a strong focus on uncertainty quantification, explainability, and real-world fit.

I bring not only hands-on technical depth—particularly in time-series modeling, sensor validation, and field-calibrated predictions but also the startup experience to take projects from prototype to production, even when the data isn’t perfect and deadlines are tight. I love the challenge of balancing scientific complexity with production-grade software.

With a career bridging machine learning, clinical informatics, and patient-facing care, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to building healthcare systems that are not only intelligent, but genuinely useful. Helping patients navigate their treatment journey with clarity and confidence is exactly the kind of high-impact work I want to be part of.

I've worn many hats in previous positions: I design APIs and databases, manage cloud resources for large data processing, generate predictive models, write core libraries, build ETL pipelines, and manage ecosystems of microservices, among others! 

At CancerLinq, I worked at the intersection of data science and clinical informatics to help oncologists deliver better care through large-scale EMR integration. I led efforts to extract structured and unstructured patient trajectories, implemented predictive models to stratify risk, and collaborated with clinicians to ensure interpretability and clinical validity. This work required a deep understanding of clinical workflows, privacy, causal reasoning, and the human context behind the data.

Since then, I’ve designed ML infrastructure and led modeling teams in logistics, agtech, and geospatial engineering. I’ve developed pipelines and prediction APIs using PySpark, MLflow, and Airflow, and deployed models via batch scoring and live inference systems. My stack typically includes Python/C++, scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL, and the AWS ecosphere for cloud solutions (ECS, EC2, SageMaker, Glue, DynamoDB, Lambda). Testable, scalable, robust automation is core to the problems I enjoy solving and I care prioritize clarity, traceability, and matching the technical approach to the clinical question.

I'm interested in real, day-to-day decisions made by providers and patients. Generally, I like working with empathetic folks, both engineers and non-engineers alike, that have personal depth, unique insights and different approaches. Please feel free to check out my profile or my resume (mypolopony.github.io) -- I'd love to chat more!

Cheers,

Hi Rhizome team,

I'm a data engineer and ML practitioner with a background in geospatial analytics, climate science pipelines, and infrastructure-oriented machine learning. I’ve worked extensively across sustainability and agtech, most recently building utility-scale geospatial pipelines at Sound Agriculture and sensor-driven data platforms at AgriData. Your mission to empower climate-resilient grid planning through data and decision intelligence speaks directly to my background,

At Sound, I designed and deployed ingestion pipelines for multi-resolution raster and vector datasets, including remote sensing data, soil maps, DEMs, and hydrology layers, combining external climate APIs and Sentinel/Landsat imagery to drive agricultural insights. These pipelines were versioned, parameterized, and monitored with Airflow, running on AWS and ultimately feeding into ML models for predictive outcomes. At AgriData, I helped develop a sensor-integrated mapping system with onboard GPS, IMUs, and LiDAR to digitize farm infrastructure in real time—building efficient ETLs for spatial segmentation and statistical analysis in the field.

My hands-on experience includes:

ETL & DAG orchestration: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Xarray), Airflow, Prefect, Spark

Geospatial stack: PostGIS, QGIS, GDAL, Rasterio, Earth Engine, satellite-derived weather and terrain data, combining rasters and vectors data for ML

Cloud and big data: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue), Delta Lake, Snowflake, Docker, Terraform

Testing & validation: Data sanity checks, pipeline verification, unit tests, CI/CD integration

Across roles, I’ve also helped shape the data interfaces for ML model deployment, writing feature extractors and optimizing storage and access patterns for large scale training and inference pipelines. I’m passionate about building modular, robust infrastructure that empowers both internal teams and real world users, especially in mission critical domains like climate adaptation and utility planning.

Rhizome’s intersection of geospatial scale, scientific rigor, and grid resilience resonates with me. I'd love to bring my technical background and system thinking to your team and help expand the impact of your platform as utilities face increasingly complex climate realities.

I like working with empathetic folks, both technical and non-technical, who bring depth, creativity, and different approaches to a shared mission. Please feel free to check out my profile or my resume (https://mypolopony.github.io) -- I'd love to chat more!


P.S. I'm excited by the grid not only as a technical dynamical system, the kind that I've spent my career studying and modeling, but also because it is a literal lifeline for millions of people, and it’s increasingly strained by the evolving climate processes. I'm excited to support resilience planning through AI, spatial data, and principled engineering and particularly excited by the combination of earth observation and practical decision-making applied to high-stakes challenges

I’m excited about Rhizome because it sits at the exact intersection of climate resilience, geospatial intelligence, and real world impact, areas that have defined much of my recent work. I’ve spent the last several years building data systems for agriculture and sustainability startups, where challenges like spatial resolution, missing data, and time-sensitive decisions were constant. Rhizome’s mission to bring clarity and foresight to utility-scale infrastructure planning through climate data feels like a natural extension of that work, and an opportunity to contribute to systems that genuinely matter.

At Sound Agriculture, I built scalable ingestion pipelines for raster and vector data from satellite imagery (Sentinel, Landsat, etc), hydrology layers, soil maps, and proprietary sources. These pipelines were orchestrated with Airflow, versioned and deployed in AWS, and structured to feed both analytics and ML workflows. At AgriData, I designed real-time ETLs from sensor networks (IMU, GPS, LiDAR) to construct field level digital representations and support inference for computer vision tasks. 

My hands-on experience includes:

- ETL & DAG orchestration: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Xarray), Airflow, Prefect, Spark
- Geospatial stack: PostGIS, QGIS, GDAL, Rasterio, Earth Engine, satellite-derived weather and terrain data, combining rasters and vectors data for ML
- Cloud and big data: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, Glue), Delta Lake, Snowflake, Docker, Terraform
- Testing & validation: Data sanity checks, pipeline verification, unit tests, CI/CD integration

While I haven’t worked directly inside a utility, much of my work has mirrored the scale and constraints of utility environments. My pipelines have handled large, heterogeneous datasets, often incomplete or noisy, and fed into downstream modeling systems under tight timelines. At CloudTrucks, I led efforts to detect anomalies in real time fleet telemetry, using streaming sensor data and event driven infrastructure to flag operational outliers. In every early stage role I’ve had, I’ve worn many hats: building infrastructure, deploying models, managing cloud resources, and coordinating with non-technical stakeholders to ensure the systems I built solved the right problems.


Warmly,

I'm a data scientist and infrastructure engineer with deep experience in time series forecasting, model deployment, and an interest in sustainability. 

My work has consistently centered on turning real world data into high impact decisions, especially in domains driven by dynamic systems and environmental constraints. At Sound Agriculture, I built geospatial pipelines to model agricultural productivity, using large raster and vector datasets to feed predictive models. At CloudTrucks, I focused on streaming time series analysis, including anomaly detection across thousands of freight telemetry feeds. In both cases, I worked closely with interdisciplinary teams, blending domain knowledge, statistical modeling, and infrastructure expertise to deliver insights at scale.

I bring extensive experience developing pipelines and predictive systems in Python, with production ML using PyTorch, XGBoost, and Scikit-Learn; orchestration via Airflow and Docker; and deployment across AWS (ECS, Lambda, SageMaker). I’m comfortable with Git-driven collaboration, SQL-based analysis, and model monitoring in fast-moving environments. Most importantly, I’m motivated by making complex models accessible to non-technical users.

I'm excited about contributing to better bidding and dispatch outcomes, collaborating across product and modeling teams, and improving predictive performance through smart feature engineering and hypothesis-driven iteration. I would love to help advance your forecasting infrastructure and push the frontier of clean energy operations.

In general, I like working with empathetic folks, both technical and non-technical, who bring depth, creativity, and different approaches to a shared mission. Please feel free to check out my profile or my resume (https://mypolopony.github.io) -- I'd love to chat more!

Hi Gridware team,

I’m a data scientist and infrastructure engineer with a background in time series analysis, statistical modeling, and large-scale sensor systems—deeply motivated by mission-driven work that protects infrastructure and enhances resilience. Gridware’s vision of combining environmental sensing with actionable decision systems speaks directly to my passions and experience.

At CloudTrucks, I designed real-time anomaly detection pipelines to monitor freight telemetry, using isolation forests to flag deviations in route adherence, stop duration, and acceleration variance. The system processed high-frequency GPS and sensor data across hundreds of vehicles, and helped operators act on early indicators of risk and inefficiency. That hands-on experience with noisy, fast-moving data has shaped how I build resilient pipelines and interpret statistical signals under uncertainty.

At AgriData, I helped build mobile sensor networks (GPS, IMU, LiDAR) for mapping crop rows in real time, designing spatial pipelines and deploying computer vision models in the field. At Sound Agriculture, I ingested and harmonized geospatial layers (including raster satellite imagery, weather data, and soil maps) into predictive models used for field optimization. In both roles, I developed statistical feature pipelines, validated models with rigorous uncertainty testing, and worked closely with hardware and domain experts to refine what our sensors could teach us about the real world.

I’m fluent in Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, and geospatial tools like geopandas and xarray. I regularly design and maintain ETL pipelines using Airflow and Docker; collaborate via Git-based workflows; and communicate results via visual dashboards or written reports depending on the audience. I have particular experience with real-time sensor data, anomaly detection, signal processing, and building interpretable models that blend statistical baselines with learned components.

Your focus on reliability, safety, and proactive insight for the electrical grid is both inspiring and urgent. I’d love to bring my technical skills and research mindset to Gridware’s Applied Research team to help surface the signals that matter and drive operational decisions with confidence.

Best,

Hi IAS Fraud Team,

I'm a data scientist and engineer with over a decade of experience delivering machine learning and data infrastructure solutions across domains, from fleet telemetry and agtech to clinical modeling and real-time computer vision. What drew me to this role is its scale, your commitment to deeply technical, scientific approaches, and your blend of research and engineering rigor in the fight against fraud.

I began my career in computational neuroscience, where I modeled signal deflection from time-locked stimuli in EEG data to classify high-risk neuropsychiatric states. That work required fluency in feature extraction, classification, and statistical modeling, and instilled in me a core intuition for time series analysis, system-level complexity, and anomaly detection that continues to shape my work today.

At AgriData, I led the development of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a mobile vision platform that digitized crop rows using on-device GPU inference and sensor fusion. I designed and deployed the model training pipeline, handled pre- and post-processing, and built the microservice-based architecture to deliver predictions in the field. This was a deeply interdisciplinary project: part robotics, part geospatial data engineering, part ML systems design. It gave me a foundation for deploying ML in production environments under real world constraints.

Since then, I've worked across sectors building scalable anomaly detection systems (CloudTrucks), ingesting multi-modal and geospatial data (Sound Agriculture), and working closely with product teams to deploy, monitor, and continuously improve ML-based systems. Across roles, I've prioritized reproducibility, interpretability, and visibility, and accountability. My favorite kinds of problems are the those that require digging, debugging, and developing new infrastructure to uncover patterns and isolate edge cases.

I'm interested in a team where fundamental science, novel ML, and production-grade impact are deeply intertwined.

In general, I like working with empathetic folks, both technical and non-technical, who bring depth, creativity, and different approaches to a shared mission. Please feel free to check out my profile or my resume (https://mypolopony.github.io) -- I'd love to chat more!

I’m especially drawn to roles where data science meets compassionate care, and insights are used to drive real improvements in people’s lives.

At UCSF, I worked in neuropsychiatric research, analyzing multimodal patient data—EEG, imaging, audio, and behavioral signals to identify early biomarkers of developmental disorders. Since then, I’ve brought that same rigor and systems thinking to real-time sensor fusion, large-scale geospatial modeling, and machine learning pipelines in startup settings. At AgriData, I built and deployed an end-to-end platform for real-time vision and sensor data in the field. At Sound Agriculture, I engineered data pipelines that integrated field trials, satellite imagery, and biological markers to support predictive modeling.

I'm excited by the opportunity at Inspiren to take what I’ve learned across clinical data, analytics infrastructure, and algorithm design and apply it to a system that directly improves care delivery in senior living. I’ve worked closely with cross-functional teams, from field operators to scientists, and enjoy turning data into insight, whether through pipelines, dashboards, or model development. I’m fluent in Python, pandas, matplotlib, and SQL, with production experience in Airflow, Tableau, and the broader AWS ecosystem.

Inspiren’s blend of clinical insight and elegant technical design really resonates with me. I’d love to contribute to your mission and help bring actionable intelligence into the hands of caregivers.

Hi Dinamo team,

I'm a computational biologist and data scientist with deep experience in high-dimensional biological modeling, bioinformatics, and systems-level analysis. My background, beginning even before medical school, spans computational modeling of protein networks, clinical neuroimaging research, and large-scale omics analysis. I'm especially drawn to the opportunity to build tools that bring clarity to complex biological systems.

In my early research, I focused on systems biology approaches to understand protein–protein interaction networks and dynamic flux models of enzyme cascades. Later, at UCSF, I led neuropsychiatric imaging studies combining time-series electrophysiology, MRI, and behavioral phenotyping. These efforts required developing robust signal processing and classification pipelines in Python, R, and MATLAB, and taught me how to extract meaningful signal from messy, noisy biological data.

I've spent the last decade in industry building data intensive systems in healthcare, agtech, and sustainability, often starting from scratch and seeing pipelines through to production. I've worked across the full data lifecycle: from molecular and sensor-level ingestion to machine learning modeling, visualization, and decision support. I've also worked with real-world clinical data, and I'm comfortable moving between ad hoc data exploration, benchmark studies, and ML/AI prototyping.

My toolkit includes Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, pyMultiOmics, OpenOmics), R, and compiled languages for performance bottlenecks. I have experience with cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Docker), and workflow managers (Airflow), and I’m always curious to learn from wet lab collaborators to help inform and validate the computational perspective.

Your commitment to combining molecular biology and advanced analytics to untangle autoimmune complexity is exactly the kind of work that motivates me, and I’d be thrilled to contribute to that mission.

Please feel free to explore more about me at https://mypolopony.github.io. I’d love to connect further.

Warm regards,
