<h2>What I Do:</h2>
<p><hl>(tl;dr):</hl>
<p>- I write computer code, mostly designing and implementing algorithms and models..  , I also develop hardware to ycapture data. I also teach computers to learn things.</p>
<p>- I develop specific hardware to capture data for analysis (recently multi-camera embedded devices for field use)</p>
<p>- I administer linux servers, manage networks and databses, ceeate pipelines from data capture -> transformation -> processing.</p>

<h2 id="recently">Things I've Done Recently:</h2>
<p>- <hl>Biomedical Computation</hl> at Stanford University</p>
<p>- three years working for the University of California in San Francisco in a <hl>computational neuroscience</hl> laboratory modeling brain-wave activity in patients with schizophrenia and predicting future outcomes</p>
<p>- modeled dynamic systems near and far, from <hl>protein interaction networks</hl> to <hl>seismic wave propagation</hl> to <hl>international supply chains</hl></p>
<p>- spent three years in <hl>medical school</hl> at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York (neurology and psychiatry)</p>
<p>- most recently, I've worked as a <hl>data scientist quantifying sustainability</hl> and creating <hl>intelligent algorithms to automatically identify</hl> environmentally preferable consumer and industrial goods. The goal: to make local governments accountable for their promises and certify their purchases</p>

<p>I like identifying abstruse data sources, developing high-throughput streams and developing new ways to extract content and meaning. 

Square pegs <--> round holes. 

I also have interests in dynamic systems, current events and primary sources, warehousing information, transforming metadata, and the how to understand information and entropy, complexity, and cats. </p>
