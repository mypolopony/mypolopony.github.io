<h1>Selwyn-Lloyd McPherson</h1>

<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>
I defined my own degree in Biomedical Computation at Stanford University, did a three-year stint working for the University of California in San Francisco in a computational neuroscience laboratory, spent three years in medical school at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, and, most recently was a data scientist understanding sustainability at ProductBio. I am passionate about complex dynamic systems, rational deduction, facts and figures, and making square pegs fit into round holes. I have interests in dynamic systems, ontologies, transforming data, and performing analytics.
