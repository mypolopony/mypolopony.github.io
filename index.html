<h2>(tl;dr)</h2>
<p>I write computer code, develop hardware and design algorithms to better understand the world. I teach computers to do things that humans aren't so good at doing. I like finding hard problems that are curious to solve. I love working with and learning from smart people who like solving problems, too!	

<h2 id="recently">Things I've Done Recently:</h2>
<p>- Full-scale ownership of an <hl>embedded robotics platform</hl> for capture and analysis of <hl>high-end computer vision</hl> products for agriculture (with <hl>GIS mapping</hl>).</p>
<p>- <hl>Computational Neuroscience</hl> at UCSF modeling brain-wave activity in patients with schizophrenia to predict future outcomes.</p>
<p>- <hl>Model generation</hl> and <hl>simulation</hl> of protein interaction networks, seismic wave propagation, international supply chains.</p>
