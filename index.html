<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>I gather and organize diverse, often obscured data to find patterns and solve problems.</p>


<h2 id="recently">Things I've Done Recently:</h2>
<p>- defined my own degree in <hl>Biomedical Computation</hl> at Stanford University</p>
<p>- spent three years working for the University of California in San Francisco in a <hl>computational neuroscience</hl> laboratory measuring brainwave activity in patients with schizophrenia</p>
<p>- modeled dynamic systems near and far, from <hl>protein interaction networks</hl> to <hl>seismic wave propagation</hl> to <hl>international supply chains</hl></p>
<p>- spent three years in <hl>medical school</hl> at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York (neurology and psychiatry)</p>
<p>- most recently, I've worked as a <hl>data scientist quantifying sustainability</hl> and creating <hl>intelligent algorithms to automatically identify</hl> environmentally preferable consumer and industrial goods</p>

<p>I am passionate about largish data, identifying obscure data sources, high-throughput information and content extraction, identity resolution, and making square pegs fit into round holes. I also have interests in dynamic systems, current events and primary sources, ontologies, transforming data, and performing analytics.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p><b>Case Western Reserve School Of Medicine, Dept. Of Biostatistics, 2006 & 2007</b></p>
<p>Developing kinetic models for the ribonucleotide reductase, an essential DNA synthesis enzyme. To do so, we wrote software to establish parameters using data from literature, interpolating delicately when necessary. Model selection was aided by in-house algorithms based on systems of partial differential equations</p>

<p>New projects occur to me faster than I can execute them. Here are some ideas that interest me.</p>

<p>- APRS and amateur radio, packet identification and tracking</p>
<p>- Information content, a la Shannon, for a selection of news outlets and other media sources</p>
<p>- Shipping vessel and container tracking to identify significant global actors and correlation with geopolitics</p>
<p>- Machine learning ALL OF THE THINGS!</p>
<br>
<p><3 always,</p>
